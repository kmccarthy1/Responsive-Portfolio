        Hello and welcome to my portfolio! My name is Kevin and Richmond, VA is my hometown! <br>
        I'm excited to learn the ins and outs of being a full stack devloper and dream of using <br>
        my skills to help others in the future. <br>
        <br>
        I spent the first 18 years of my life in Richmond before going to college in Fredericksburg, VA <br>
        at the University of Mary Washington. While there, I competed for their collegiate Cross <br>
        Country and Track & Field teams. Although I no longer compete for the university, my love <br>
        for running has not ended. I'm currently training to race the Richmond Marathon in November;
        a race I see as equally thrilling and terrifying.<br>
        <br>
        My interest for coding & development began in college, but never really went anywhere as I pursued a career as a GIS 
        Analyst using the skills I learned in the GIS (Geographic Information Systems) field. Although, I'm still interested
        in GIS, I learned it wasn't something I could do forever with a small job market and automation on the horizon. I'm
        excited to hone my skills in the coming months and be able to show off cool projects here on this site!<br>
